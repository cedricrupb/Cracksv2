Xero was founded by Rod Drury and his personal accountant when they felt that traditional desktop accounting software had become outdated and decided to create a modern cloud-based product.

The company entered the Australian market and the United Kingdom in 2008, and United States in 2011.

=== Funding ===
Xero went public on the New Zealand Exchange on June 5, 2007 with a $15 million (NZD) IPO, gaining 15% on its first trading day. Drury decided to list on the NZX rather than receive investment from Silicon Valley in order to avoid being pressured into selling to a larger competing company. The company focused on the New Zealand market and product and development for its first five years before entering other markets. It went public on the Australian Securities Exchange on November 8, 2012. Xero transitioned to a sole listing on the ASX on February 5, 2018, delisting from the NZX on February 2, 2018.
