Originally the developers of a print-publishing application called Uniqorn. Development of Uniqorn ended after Apple discontinued printing support for its QuickDraw GX component.
The company initiated development of Freeway (currently version 7) in 1996, a DTP (Desktop publishing)-style website creation program. Freeway was an HTML generator, as opposed to an HTML editor, allowing users to design in similar ways to DTP applications rather than work directly with code.

Softpress Systems was managed by Joe Billings (Managing Director), Richard Logan (Financial Director), and Stewart Fellows (Technical Director).
