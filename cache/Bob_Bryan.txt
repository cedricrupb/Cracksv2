== Abstract == 
Robert Charles Bryan (born April 29, 1978) is an American professional tennis player. He has won twenty-three Grand Slam titles: 16 in men's doubles and 7 in mixed doubles. He turned professional in 1998. With his twin brother Mike, he has been the world No. 1 doubles player for much of the last several years, first achieving the top ranking in September 2003. The brothers were named ATP Team of the Decade for 2000–2009. The brothers became the second men's doubles team to complete the career Golden Slam at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. 
Bob Bryan ended his 2018 season early with subsequent hip surgery in August 2018 due to an injury he sustained during his Madrid final retirement earlier in May 2018, which would have elevated the Bryan brothers as the oldest players back to the top of the men's doubles ranking if they were victorious. His recovery from hip surgery took around 5 months, which led his brother Mike to partner primarily with fellow compatriot Jack Sock during Bob's absence.
