== History ==

Intergraph was founded in 1969 as M&S Computing, Inc., by former IBM engineers  Jim
Meadlock, his wife Nancy, Terry Schansman (the S of M&S), Keith Schonrock, and
Robert Thurber who had been working with NASA and the U.S. Army in developing systems that would apply digital computing to real time missile guidance. The company was later renamed to Intergraph Corporation in 1980.In 2000, Intergraph exited the hardware business and became purely a software company. On July 21, 2000, it sold its Intense3D graphics accelerator division to 3Dlabs, and its workstation and server division to Silicon Graphics.The companies incorporated SmartSketch, a drawing program used previously for the PenPoint OS and EO tablet computer. When Pen computing did not take off, SmartSketch was ported to the Windows and Macintosh platforms.On November 29, 2006, Intergraph was acquired by an investor group led by Hellman & Friedman LLC, Texas Pacific Group and JMI Equity, making the company privately held. On October 28, 2010, Intergraph was acquired by Hexagon AB. The transaction marks the return of Intergraph as part of a publicly traded company. 
As part of the Hexagon acquisition, Hexagon moved the management of ERDAS, Inc. from under Leica Geosystems to Intergraph, and Z/I Imaging airborne imaging sensors from under Intergraph to Leica Geosystems.On December 2, 2013, the geospatial technology portfolio was split out from  under the Intergraph Security, Government and Infrastructure division to form the Hexagon Geospatial division. On October 13, 2015, the Intergraph Security, Government & Infrastructure division was rebranded as Hexagon Safety & Infrastructure. On January 9, 2017, the Intergraph Government Solutions division was rebranded as Hexagon US Federal.On June 5, 2017, the Intergraph Process, Power & Marine division was rebranded as Hexagon PPM.
