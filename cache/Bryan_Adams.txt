== Life and career ==


=== Early life ===
Bryan Guy Adams was born on 5 November 1959 in Kingston, Ontario, Canada, to parents from the United Kingdom: Elizabeth Jane (n√©e Watson) and Captain Conrad J. Adams, who emigrated to Canada from Plymouth, England in the 1950s. Adams' father, a Sandhurst officer in the British Army, joined the Canadian Army and later spent time as a United Nations peacekeeping observer for Canada, which led to him becoming a Canadian foreign service diplomat. Adams travelled with his parents to diplomatic postings in Lisbon, Portugal (where he attended the American School of Lisbon) and Vienna, Austria, during the 1960s, and to Tel Aviv, Israel during the early 1970s.Raised in Ottawa, Adams attended Colonel By Secondary School in the Beacon Hill neighbourhood of East Ottawa. In 1974, Adams, his mother, and younger brother Bruce moved to North Vancouver while his father was posted abroad.


=== Early career ===
By age 15, Adams had started working in the Vancouver music scene.In late 1976, Adams became the vocalist for pub band Sweeney Todd, who had only a few months earlier hit number 1 on the Canadian charts with a song "Roxy Roller". Adams was made to sing a re-make of the song for the US, which made it to number 99 on the US charts.  The new incarnation of the band released an album If Wishes Were Horses (1977) with Adams billed as "Bryan Guy Adams" on vocals.
In 1978 at age 18, Adams met Jim Vallance through a mutual friend in a Vancouver music store. Vallance was the former drummer and principal songwriter for Vancouver-based rock band Prism and had recently quit that band to focus on a career as a studio musician and songwriter. They agreed to meet at Vallance's home studio a few days later, which proved to be the beginning of a partnership which, as of  2017, is still in existence.Later in 1978, Adams signed to A&M records for one dollar. Some of the first demos written and recorded in 1978 have surfaced over the years, most notably "I'm Ready", recorded for both the Cuts Like a Knife and MTV Unplugged albums, and "Remember", recorded for his first album. Both songs were covered by other artists even before his first album was released.Also recorded during this time was the disco song "Let Me Take You Dancing", featuring Adams' vocals sped up to meet the 122BPM dance tempo. The song made the Canadian RPM chart in March 1979 along with its B-Side "Don't Turn Me Away"."Straight From The Heart" was also written during this period. The song was later recorded for Adams's third album Cuts Like A Knife in 1983 and released as a single, becoming Adams's first top 10 record in the U.S. in 1983.


=== 1980s ===
Adams's self-titled debut album was released in February 1980 and marked the beginning of what was to become a long songwriting partnership between Adams and co-writer Jim Vallance. With the exception of "Remember" and "Wastin' Time", most of the album was recorded from 29 October up until 29 November 1979 at Manta Studios and co-produced by Adams and Vallance. The album was certified gold in Canada in 1986.Adams's second album, You Want It You Got It, was recorded in two weeks and it marked Adams's first album co-produced by Bob Clearmountain. It was released in 1981 and contained the FM album-oriented rock radio hit "Lonely Nights", (as well as Seattle-area favorite "Fits Ya Good") but it was not until the third album that he achieved international recognition. Adams also co-wrote songs for other artists during this time including Billboard charted songs like "No Way to Treat a Lady" for Bonnie Raitt and "Don't Let Him Know" for Prism.Cuts Like a Knife, which was released in January 1983, was Adams's breakout album due mainly to the lead singles. "Straight from the Heart" was the most successful song, reaching number 10 on the Billboard Hot 100. Another single, "Cuts Like a Knife" charted at number 15. "This Time" also placed on the Hot 100. Music videos were released for four of the singles from the album. "Cuts Like a Knife" arguably became Adams's most recognizable and popular song from the album. Its music video received heavy airplay on music television channels. The album peaked at number eight on the Billboard 200 album chart and achieved three times platinum status in Canada, platinum in the United States and gold in Australia.Adams's album, Reckless, produced by Adams and Bob Clearmountain, peaked at number one on the Billboard 200. The album was released in November 1984 and featured the singles, "Run to You", "Summer of '69", "Heaven", "One Night Love Affair", "Somebody", and "It's Only Love", a duet with Tina Turner. All the singles had accompanying music videos and all peaked in the Top 15 of the Billboard Hot 100 with "Run to You" (number 6) and "Summer of '69" (number 5),  peaking in the top ten; "Heaven" became the most successful single from Reckless at the time of its release on the pop charts, reaching number one on the Billboard Hot 100. "Heaven" had reached number nine on the mainstream rock chart the previous year as it been released as a non-album track "Run To You" was the most successful single at album-oriented rock stations as it spent 4 weeks at the top of the mainstream rock chart.  "It's Only Love" was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rock Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group. In 1986, the song won an MTV award for Best Stage Performance.

== Personal life ==
Bryan Adams has been a vegan for over 29 years; he quit eating meat and dairy in 1989.  He relayed his experiences with his plant based diet in an interview with Vegan Life Magazine in 2016 :"For those people who aren't veggie or vegan it was the best gift I could ever give myself to do it. I am turning 57 years old this year and I work hard, I am always on the move but I have tons of energy because I am plant-based. It is absolutely the best thing you could ever do for yourself. It is a great path."Adams has never married. In the 1990s, he was in a relationship with Danish model Cecilie Thomsen. Adams and Alicia Grimaldi, his former personal assistant and now trustee and co-founder of his namesake foundation, had their first daughter in April 2011. They announced the birth of their second daughter in February 2013. Aside from his British parents, his grandmother was born in Malta. Adams has homes in Chelsea, London, and Paris.
