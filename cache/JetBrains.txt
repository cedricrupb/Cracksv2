==== ReSharper Ultimate ====
ReSharper Ultimate is a group of products containing the award-winning ReSharper plugin for Visual Studio, dotCover, a code coverage tool, dotMemory, a memory profiler, dotTrace, a performance profiler and dotPeek, a disassembler. ReSharper provides a series of features for Visual Studio developers including code analysis, refactoring, navigation, test runner, build runner and more.


=== Programming languages ===


==== Kotlin ====

Kotlin is a statically typed programming language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine and also can be compiled to JavaScript source code. The name comes from the Kotlin Island, near St. Petersburg.
Kotlin is designed to be an industrial-strength object-oriented language, and a "better language" than Java, but still be fully interoperable with Java code, allowing companies to make a gradual migration from Java to Kotlin.


==== MPS ====

MPS (Meta Programming System) is an open-source language workbench that focuses on Domain-specific Languages (DSLs). It leverages projectional editing instead of classical textual editing offering easy language composition, multiple code visualizations as well as various non-textual notations for DSL designers. MPS comes with its own code generation engine, which can be used to provide semantics for MPS-based DSLs. In addition to editor and generator declaration, MPS provides the possibility to capture information about other language aspects like type-system, constraints, data flow, and others.


=== Team tools ===


==== Hub ====
Hub is a free JetBrains Team Tools connector. It enables advanced integration between JetBrains team collaboration tools: YouTrack, Upsource, Teamcity. A user can log in once in Hub and stay authenticated in all JetBrains tools throughout. Hub also manages a single database of users, groups, roles, permissions, projects, and shares it among all connected YouTrack and Upsource installations. It provides a Dashboard to track issues, commits, build status and more data from YouTrack, TeamCity and Upsource.


==== TeamCity ====

TeamCity is a continuous integration and continuous delivery server developed by JetBrains. It is a server-based web application written in Java. TeamCity is a proprietary commercial software with a Freemium license for up to 20 build configurations and three free build agents.

Upsource provides syntax highlighting for multiple programming languages. Having IntelliJ IDEA core in it, Upsource provides server-side static code analysis, code-aware navigation, and usage search for Java, PHP, JavaScript and Kotlin languages.


==== YouTrack ====

YouTrack is a proprietary, commercial web-based bug tracker, issue tracking system, and agile project management software developed by JetBrains. It focuses on development teams, providing them with query-based issue search with auto-completion, manipulating issues in batches,[2] extended keyboard-shortcuts support, customizing the set of issue attributes,[3] and creating custom workflows.[4] YouTrack provides support for both Scrum and Kanban methodologies and allows developers to follow a custom process. YouTrack is localized into English, German, Russian, Spanish and French. YouTrack is available as SaaS and on-premises. Free version includes up to 10 users.


=== Toolbox App ===
Toolbox App is an application that facilitates easy installation and uninstallation of JetBrains IDEs. It allows users to log in with a JetBrains account and install all of the products they own.


== Revenue model ==
JetBrains IDEs have several license options, which feature same software abilities and differ in their price and terms of use.
The team products are available as hosted and installed versions and have free versions for small teams.
Many products are free for open source projects and educational institutions.IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate and PyCharm are the only paid products in a field of free or open source options.


== Open source projects ==
In 2009, JetBrains open-sourced the core functionality of IntelliJ IDEA by offering the free Community Edition. It is built on the IntelliJ Platform and includes its sources. JetBrains released both under Apache License 2.0. In 2010, Android support became a part of the Community Edition, and two years later Google announced its Android Studio, the IDE for mobile development on Android platform built on the Community Edition of IntelliJ IDEA and an official alternative to Eclipse Android Developer Tool. In June 2015, it was announced that the support of Eclipse ADT will be discontinued making Android Studio the official tool for Android App development.MPS, short for meta programming system, and Kotlin, a statically typed programming language for JVM, are both open source and non-commercial.


== Past projects ==
Fabrique is a rapid application development (RAD) software framework for building custom web and enterprise applications. Introduced in 2004, it is apparently dead since 2008.
Omea is a desktop-based reader and organizer for RSS (and later of every bit of information that comes across one's desktop), the first and so far the only consumer-oriented product from JetBrains. Introduced in 2004, it failed to gain expected popularity. In 2008, having reached v 2.2, Omea was open-sourced under the GNU General Public License (GPL) v2. The product is still available for download, and after the retirement of Google Reader, has gained some attention again.Astella is an IDE for Adobe Flash and Apache Flex. This most short-lived JetBrains product was announced in October 2011, just a month before Adobe Systems killed Mobile Flash.
