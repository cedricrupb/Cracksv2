== History ==
G Data was founded in Bochum, Germany in 1985. The company introduced its first computer security product Anti-Virus Kit (AVK) in 1988 for Atari ST.Beside focus on the security market, G Data also created software for voice recognition (Invox) and speech synthesis (Logox).G Data computer security products use two scan-engines, originally by Avast and Bitdefender. The 2014 release introduced their own scan-engine (CloseGap), which replaced Avast. However, the upgrade to new version was not painless, as users of weaker computers experienced system slowdowns. The company promptly solved this issue by an update.In September 2015, G Data launched a new messaging app called Secure Chat which uses the Signal Protocol. The application is based on a fork of Signal and its source code is published under the GPLv3 license.
