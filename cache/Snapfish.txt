== History ==
Snapfish was launched in 1999 by business partners Rajil Kapoor, Bala Parthasarathy, Suneet Wadhwa, and Shripati Acharya. Ben Nelson joined soon thereafter as corporate development operations lead, to become CFO and later president. Jasbir Patel is now the president and CEO of snapfish.In 2005, Snapfish was bought by HP. While HP did not disclose the acquisition sum, a Merrill Lynch report estimated that HP may have paid between $300 and 400 million for Snapfish, while Snapfishâ€™s revenue was less than $100 million. Snapfish co-founder Raj Kapoor confirmed in a 2011 interview that the acquisition price was $300 Million.In 2004, Snapfish opened a physical retail concept store in Alexandria, Virginia, but they later closed the retail store.As of 2007, Snapfish claimed to have 40 million members and to host 1 billion digital pictures. In August 2013, Snapfish announced on their local websites (and through a mailing to members) that they were shutting down the service in Belgium, India, the Netherlands and Spain. They advised existing users to use Pixum and Photojaanic as a replacement service.
In April 2015, HP reached an agreement to sell Snapfish back to District Photo. Under the terms of the sale, HP allowed the company to continue to use its printing services.During a website conversion in 2016 Snapfish had a data loss while converting to their new web system. Photos prior to January 2014 were unable to be migrated to the new website system. Snapfish said that although some photo albums were recovered, others will remain empty. Typically Snapfish has three versions of images: high resolution, low resolution, and printable images. Both the high resolution and low resolution were lost and the backup files for the printable images were not recoverable.
