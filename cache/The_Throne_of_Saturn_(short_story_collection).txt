Boucher and McComas described the 1949 edition as "twelve superb short stories of a future in which the new gods have led man into strange scientific and sociological bypaths -- a book it would be difficult to overpraise." P. Schuyler Miller praised the collection as "imaginative fiction entirely different from anything else you are likely to find in print."
