He served as Prime Minister of the Netherlands from 6 July 1971 until 11 May 1973.A Civil servant and Trade Union Leader by occupation, he was General Secretary of the Christian Farmers and Gardeners Association of the Netherlands (CBTB) from 1952 until 1959 and Chairman 1959 until 1963. Biesheuvel became a Member of the House of Representatives on 6 November 1956 after the Dutch general election of 1956. On 7 March 1961 he was selected as a Member of the European Parliament and dual served in those positions until 24 July 1963. Biesheuvel became the lijsttrekker (top candidate) of the Anti-Revolutionary Party for the general election of 1963 and served as Party leader from 1 July 1963 until 7 March 1973. The Anti-Revolutionary Party lost one seat but the following cabinet formation resulted in a coalition agreement which formed the Marijnen cabinet, Biesheuvel became Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries and Minister for Suriname and Netherlands Antilles Affairs. On 28 February 1965 the Marijnen cabinet fell and was replaced by the Cals cabinet, Biesheuvel remained as Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries and Minister for Suriname and Netherlands Antilles Affairs but served alongside Anne Vondeling as Deputy Prime Minister. On 14 October 1966 the Cals cabinet also fell and a rump Zijlstra cabinet was formed on 22 November 1966 Biesheuvel again remained as Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries and Minister for Suriname and Netherlands Antilles Affairs and this time served alongside former Prime Minister Jan de Quay as Deputy Prime Minister. For the general election of 1967 Biesheuvel again as lijsttrekker won two seats, primarily due to the popularity of Prime Minister Jelle Zijlstra. However, Zijlstra announced he did not want the serve a full term as Prime Minister and endorsed his party leader Biesheuvel. The following cabinet formation failed to result in a coalition agreement to form a Biesheuvel cabinet, and after a new cabinet formation the De Jong cabinet was formed. Biesheuvel became the Parliamentary leader of the Anti-Revolutionary Party in the House of Representatives on 16 February 1967 and returned to the House of Representatives on 23 February 1967.
The De Jong cabinet served a complete full term and for the general election of 1971 Biesheuvel again as lijsttrekker lost two seats, but the following cabinet formation resulted in a coalition agreement to form the first Biesheuvel cabinet. Biesheuvel became Prime Minister of the Netherlands and Minister of General Affairs. On 19 July 1972 the first Biesheuvel cabinet fell and a rump second Biesheuvel cabinet was formed on 9 August 1972. For the general election of 1972 Biesheuvel again as lijsttrekker won one seat and Biesheuvel again became the Parliamentary leader of the Anti-Revolutionary Party in the House of Representatives on 30 November 1972 and returned to the House of Representatives on 7 December 1972. But the following slow cabinet formation resulted in a coalition agreement which formed the Den Uyl cabinet and Biesheuvel announced his retirement from politics and stood down as Leader of the Anti-Revolutionary Party and resigned as Parliamentary leader of the Anti-Revolutionary Party in the House of Representatives and as a Member of the House of Representatives on 7 March 1973. Biesheuvel remained as Prime Minister until the Den Uyl cabinet was installed on 11 May 1973.
