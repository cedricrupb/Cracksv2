== Profile ==
Intuit Canada was founded following the acquisition of a Canadian company in 1993 by Intuit. In 1992, Edmontonians and University of Alberta graduates Bruce Johnson and Chad Frederick had built a tax preparation product called WINTAX - Canada's first Microsoft Windows-based personal tax preparation software. In 1993, they agreed to be acquired by Chipsoft, manufacturer of the U.S. personal income tax software TurboTax. Shortly after the WINTAX acquisition, Chipsoft agreed to merge with Intuit, the developer of the Quicken financial software.Intuit Canada continued to update and support the WINTAX software, which was renamed QuickTax in 1995 and then renamed TurboTax in 2010. Intuit Canada quickly became the hub for international development at Intuit, producing localized versions of Quicken and QuickBooks for Canada (in French and English) and the United Kingdom. The U.K. version of Quicken was discontinued in 2005.

== Recent changes ==
In 2008, Intuit Canada discontinued the TaxWiz software and added QuickTax Basic to their lineup.  Changes made by the Canada Revenue Agency forced Intuit and other tax preparing software companies to limit the number of returns available from their software to 20. This caused Intuit Canada to stop offering QuickTax Pro50 and Pro100 products, and they now offer QuickTax 20 as an alternative.
Intuit Canada has since announced that for the 2010 tax year, they will discontinue use of the name QuickTax and replace it with the name TurboTax - thus bringing the product in line with Intuit's American tax-filing software.


== Awards ==
In October 2008, Intuit Canada was named one of Alberta's Top Employers by Mediacorp Canada Inc., which was announced by the Calgary Herald and the Edmonton Journal.
